Net::Oping
==========

  ICMP latency measurement module using the oping library.

DESCRIPTION

  This Perl module is a high-level interface to the oping library. Its purpose
  it to send "ICMP ECHO_REQUEST" packets (also known as "ping") to a host and
  measure the time that elapses until the reception of an "ICMP ECHO_REPLY"
  packet (also known as "pong"). If no such packet is received after a certain
  timeout the host is considered to be unreachable.

  The used "oping" library supports "ping"ing multiple hosts in parallel and
  works with IPv4 and IPv6 transparently. Other advanced features that are
  provided by the underlying library, such as setting the data sent or
  configuring the time of live (TTL) are not yet supported by this interface.

INSTALLATION

  This module is compiled and installed in the standard Perl way:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
